### Features ‚úÖ
- Creation of bank accounts based on cardholder name, id, and desired account type.
- Transaction system (deposit, withdrawal, transfer) based on the cardholder ID initially registered in the account.
- Report generation (Accounts registered in the app and transaction log according to cardholder's id account)
- Each account includes its account number, which is automatically generated by the builder, as well as each transaction.

### Important notes üõë
- Due to the simplicity of the project, no error control was implemented. </br></br>
  - The handling of nulls and input control according to the type of data requested from the user will normally cause the program to halt due to an exception. </br>
  - Transaction amounts and balances are handled with float variables. </br></br>
- The project structure has been separated into different packages for greater order. The enums package manages the handling of menus, certain attributes of classes, etc. </br></br>
  - The transaction packages are subclasses that inherit features from the main Transactions class.
  - IOHandler is in charge of providing methods for inputs and outputs with a simpler syntax based on JOptionPane. </br></br>
- Names and ID's are Strings. Feel free using the format that you want.
